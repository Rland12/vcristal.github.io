<p><i>THE OTHERWORDLY AURORA borealis,</i> or northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere—
  at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles—when charged particles from the sun become trapped in
  the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.<br><br> The first time
  I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more accesible
  places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial
  scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light pollution. Find your
  magnetic latitude on NOAA and here. <br><br>
  In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not
  neccessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets
  more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox
  in September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your
  location here, or by using a sky guide app.
