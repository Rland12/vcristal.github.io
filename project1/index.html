<!--FIX: Check Onenote on how to preven the text from overflowing-->
<p><i><b>Iceland</b></i> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where
  dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred
  a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

The aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn. Aurora,
and the Greak name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot
for this magnificent lightshow.<br> The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the
Northen Lights is a natural phenomenom created when particles emitted by the sun interact
with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar
luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>

<p class="white"> When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's
namesake—namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practices year-round
and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which
day trips are offered from Reykjavík (and Skaftafell).</p>
